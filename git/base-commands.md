# Base commands

## Fetch

This will synchronize my local branches with the remote ones

```text
git fetch
```

## Pull

Git pull is a combination of two commands: Git fetch and git merge. It's useful to retrieve the contents from a remote and update the local repository.

```text
git pull origin master
```
